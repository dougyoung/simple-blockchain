# Simple Blockchain

A simple implementation of a proof-of-work blockchain in Python3 geared towards clarity of concept and simplicity in implementation.

The goal of this project is to serve as an educational tool and reference for learning.

## Getting started

### Dependencies

```
Python 3.6.x
```

### How to run

```bash
# python3 run.py [difficulty]
```

### How to run tests

```bash
# python3 tests.py
```

#### Difficulty

Difficulty defines the probability of finding a valid hash for a given block. The smaller the difficulty the more difficult it
is to find a nonce that yields a valid block. This number is static within the system to preserve the simplicity principle.

`difficulty` is an integer or float or a string that evaluates to an integer or float e.g. `1e71 * 5`.

Default is `1e71`. Increase this number if the proof-of-work portion of the program runs slow on your computer.

## Notes

This project represents a single node in a networkless proof-of-work based cryptocurrency system. As such it does not cover various concepts:

1. Peer networking and message passing
2. Transaction system
3. More sophisticated consensus rules validation
4. Best chain detection and replacement
5. Chain persistence
